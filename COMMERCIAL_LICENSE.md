Author: pb_2n^ (孔穆清)

This document defines the commercial licensing and usage policy for the W2UOS project.

W2UOS is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0 as an open-source project.  
This Commercial Licensing Policy applies to proprietary, enterprise, or revenue-generating use cases that go beyond standard open-source usage.

## 1. Open Source License (Apache-2.0)

W2UOS is primarily distributed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

Under the Apache-2.0 License, you are permitted to:

- Use W2UOS for personal, research, or internal business purposes.
- Modify the source code.
- Distribute original or modified versions.
- Use the software in commercial products or services.

You must, at all times:

- Retain the original copyright notices.
- Retain the LICENSE and NOTICE files.
- Provide proper attribution to the original author and project.

The full legal terms are defined in the LICENSE file.

## 2. When a Commercial License Is Required

A separate commercial license or written authorization from the author is REQUIRED if you:

- Provide W2UOS as a hosted SaaS, PaaS, or managed trading service.
- Offer W2UOS as part of a paid financial, trading, or investment product.

- Use the W2UOS name, logo, or branding in a commercial offering.
- Integrate W2UOS into proprietary enterprise systems distributed to third parties.

In these cases, Apache-2.0 alone is NOT sufficient and a commercial agreement is required.
